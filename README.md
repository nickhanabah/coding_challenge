## This is my approach to your coding challenge you sent

The important notebook with the exercises and my general modelling approach can be found in `notebooks/`.
The main parts are: 
- some small explorative data analysis (distributional plots & correlations)
- data preprocessing and feature engineering for modelling 
- modelling and evaluation

The provided files that consist of the dependent and independent variables can be found in `df/`.
